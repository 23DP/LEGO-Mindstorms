My part of the projest for RealTimeControlAlgorithms course 

Theme: Veljko is the name of the robot, that will play the role of the parking lot officer. When he receives the signal that a new
car parked, he will wait for some time, and take a tour to check if the driver had paid the parking.
To do this, he has to follow a line on the lot, and stop when he reaches the car (he will have a sensor on the parking spot, that
is how he will know where to stop). After that, he should return to his starting point, and wait until he recieves another signal
